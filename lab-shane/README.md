# Lab 24 Bunny Display Widgets

This project utilizes custom directives to show memes of Drake, naturally.  From the home page, there is a list of links each with a corresponding full size image.  Additionally, there is a link in the top right navbar for a thumbnail view instead of text.  There is also a Sample link that mocks up what each of the three views would like like for a sample image.
